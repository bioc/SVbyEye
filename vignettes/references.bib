               technology and Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) produce reads
               over 10 kb in length, which have enabled high-quality genome
               assembly at an affordable cost. However, at present, long reads
               have an error rate as high as 10-15\%. Complex and
               computationally intensive pipelines are required to assemble such
               reads. RESULTS: We present a new mapper, minimap and a de novo
               assembler, miniasm, for efficiently mapping and assembling SMRT
               and ONT reads without an error correction stage. They can often
               assemble a sequencing run of bacterial data into a single contig
               in a few minutes, and assemble 45-fold Caenorhabditis elegans
               data in 9 min, orders of magnitude faster than the existing
               pipelines, though the consensus sequence error rate is as high as
               raw reads. We also introduce a pairwise read mapping format and a
               graphical fragment assembly format, and demonstrate the
               interoperability between ours and current tools. AVAILABILITY AND

               identical segmental duplications (SDs) are among the last regions

               Using a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome (T2T-CHM13),
               we present a comprehensive view of human SD organization. SDs
               account for nearly one-third of the additional sequence,
               increasing the genome-wide estimate from 5.4 to 7.0\% [218
               million base pairs (Mbp)]. An analysis of 268 human genomes shows
               that 91\% of the previously unresolved T2T-CHM13 SD sequence
               (68.3 Mbp) better represents human copy number variation.
               Comparing long-read assemblies from human (n = 12) and nonhuman
               primate (n = 5) genomes, we systematically reconstruct the
               evolution and structural haplotype diversity of biomedically
               relevant and duplicated genes. This analysis reveals patterns of

               genetic, epigenetic, and evolutionary variation within
               centromeres from a diversity panel of humans and apes. We find
               that centromere single-nucleotide variation can increase by up to
               4.1-fold relative to other genomic regions, with the caveat that
               up to 45.8\% of centromeric sequence, on average, cannot be
               reliably aligned with current methods due to the emergence of new
               $\alpha$-satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) structures and two
               to threefold differences in the length of the centromeres. The
               extent to which this occurs differs depending on the chromosome
               and haplotype. Comparing the two sets of complete human
               centromeres, we find that eight harbor distinctly different
               $\alpha$-satellite HOR array structures and four contain novel
               $\alpha$-satellite HOR variants in high abundance. DNA
               methylation and CENP-A chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
               show that 26\% of the centromeres differ in their kinetochore
               position by at least 500 kbp-a property not readily associated
               with novel $\alpha$-satellite HORs. To understand evolutionary
               change, we selected six chromosomes and sequenced and assembled
               31 orthologous centromeres from the common chimpanzee, orangutan,
               and macaque genomes. Comparative analyses reveal nearly complete
               turnover of $\alpha$-satellite HORs, but with idiosyncratic
               changes in structure characteristic to each species. Phylogenetic
               reconstruction of human haplotypes supports limited to no
               recombination between the p- and q-arms of human chromosomes and
               reveals that novel $\alpha$-satellite HORs share a monophyletic
               origin, providing a strategy to estimate the rate of saltatory
               amplification and mutation of human centromeric DNA.",
