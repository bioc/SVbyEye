               technology and Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) produce reads
               over 10 kb in length, which have enabled high-quality genome
               assembly at an affordable cost. However, at present, long reads
               have an error rate as high as 10-15\%. Complex and
               computationally intensive pipelines are required to assemble such
               reads. RESULTS: We present a new mapper, minimap and a de novo
               assembler, miniasm, for efficiently mapping and assembling SMRT
               and ONT reads without an error correction stage. They can often
               assemble a sequencing run of bacterial data into a single contig
               in a few minutes, and assemble 45-fold Caenorhabditis elegans
               data in 9 min, orders of magnitude faster than the existing
               pipelines, though the consensus sequence error rate is as high as
               raw reads. We also introduce a pairwise read mapping format and a
               graphical fragment assembly format, and demonstrate the
               interoperability between ours and current tools. AVAILABILITY AND
